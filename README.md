# SimpleFactoryPattern

- Summary: Creational Design Pattern that enables the centralization of creation logic for different child implementations of an object (class/interface) in order to follow the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. It also adheres to the Encapsulate-What-Varies principle by centralizing the code that is most likely to change.

- Logic: It depends on creating a factory class with a method that defines the initialization setup.
- Result: This results in applying the required setup in a centralized and encapsulated location, instead of repeating it on multiple areas.

- The Project contains Two branches: 1- legacy: With legacy code to show the code without implementing the pattern 2- master: with the pattern applied.
