# StrategyPattern

- Summary: A Behavioral Design Pattern, used to reduce the complixity of different behaviors of the same object, instead of doing numerious if statements.

- Logic: It depends on creating an interface with the action method (A.K.A Context), and implementing a data structure of each required behavior
- Result: This results in applying the required policies/strategies, while encapsulating each strategy logic on the relevant implementation data structure.

- The Project contains Two branches: 1- legacy: With legacy code to show the code without implementing the pattern 2- master: with the pattern applied.
