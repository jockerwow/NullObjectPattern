# SimpleFactoryPattern

- Summary: A Creational Design Pattern, used to follow the DRY priciple by centeralizing the initialization of different childs/implementations of the same object (class/interface).

- Logic: It depends on creating a factory class with a method that defines the initialization setup.
- Result: This results in applying the required setup in a centralized and encapsulated location, instead of repeating it on multiple areas.

- The Project contains Two branches: 1- legacy: With legacy code to show the code without implementing the pattern 2- master: with the pattern applied.
